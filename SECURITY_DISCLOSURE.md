## Overview

This document discloses critical security vulnerabilities discovered in the BitChat application during a comprehensive security audit. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to intercept communications, impersonate users, and compromise the entire messaging system.

## Vulnerability Summary

| CVE ID | Severity | Component | Impact |
|--------|----------|-----------|---------|
| PENDING | CRITICAL | Bluetooth Service | Man-in-the-Middle attacks |
| PENDING | HIGH | Encryption Service | Private key exposure |
| PENDING | HIGH | Protocol Parser | Buffer overflow / DoS |
| PENDING | HIGH | Authentication | Identity spoofing |
| PENDING | MEDIUM | Message Handler | Replay attacks |

## Detailed Vulnerabilities

### 1. CVE-PENDING-001: Unauthenticated Bluetooth Connections (CVSS 9.1)

**Component**: BluetoothMeshService.swift  
**Lines**: 2325, 2461-2470

**Description**: The application automatically connects to any device advertising the BitChat service UUID (550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000) without any authentication or user confirmation.

**Impact**: An attacker within Bluetooth range can:
- Force connections from any BitChat user
- Perform man-in-the-middle attacks on all communications
- Impersonate any user
- Intercept and modify messages

**Proof of Concept**:
```swift
// Attacker advertises BitChat service UUID
// Victim automatically connects
// Attacker performs MITM on key exchange
// All subsequent communications compromised
```

### 2. CVE-PENDING-002: Insecure Cryptographic Key Storage (CVSS 7.5)

**Component**: EncryptionService.swift  
**Lines**: 57-68

**Description**: Private cryptographic keys are stored in UserDefaults instead of the iOS Keychain, making them accessible to any process with app sandbox access.

**Impact**:
- Keys can be extracted from device backups
- Keys accessible on jailbroken devices
- No hardware encryption protection
- Keys persist across app reinstalls

**Proof of Concept**:
```swift
// On jailbroken device or from backup:
let privateKey = UserDefaults.standard.data(forKey: "privateKey")
// Attacker now has permanent access to user's private key
```

### 3. CVE-PENDING-003: Multiple Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.3)

**Component**: BinaryProtocol.swift  
**Lines**: 170-172, 364, Multiple locations

**Description**: The protocol parser performs unchecked array slicing operations that can read beyond buffer boundaries when processing malformed packets.

**Impact**:
- Application crash (DoS)
- Potential memory corruption
- Information disclosure through memory leaks

**Proof of Concept**:
```swift
// Send packet with payloadLength > actual data length
// Parser attempts to read beyond buffer
// Application crashes or leaks memory
```

### 4. CVE-PENDING-004: Weak Peer Identification (CVSS 6.5)

**Component**: BluetoothMeshService.swift  
**Lines**: 260-262

**Description**: Peer IDs use only 4 bytes (32 bits) of randomness, enabling collision attacks with ~65,536 attempts for 50% probability.

**Impact**:
- Peer impersonation
- Message spoofing
- Network disruption

### 5. CVE-PENDING-005: Extended Replay Attack Window (CVSS 6.1)

**Component**: BluetoothMeshService.swift  
**Lines**: 1393-1398

**Description**: Messages are accepted within a 5-minute timestamp window, allowing extended replay attacks.

**Impact**:
- Message replay attacks
- State manipulation
- Denial of service through message flooding

### 6. CVE-PENDING-006: Predictable Password Derivation (CVSS 5.9)

**Component**: ChatViewModel.swift  
**Lines**: 712-714

**Description**: Channel names are used as salts for PBKDF2 password derivation, making rainbow table attacks feasible.

**Impact**:
- Pre-computation attacks on common channel names
- Reduced password security
- Channel compromise

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Complete Communication Takeover
1. Attacker advertises BitChat service UUID
2. Victims automatically connect without authentication
3. Attacker performs MITM on all key exchanges
4. All communications can be decrypted and modified

### Scenario 2: Persistent Key Compromise
1. Attacker gains temporary device access
2. Extracts private keys from UserDefaults
3. Permanent ability to decrypt all future communications
4. Keys persist even after app deletion

### Scenario 3: Network Disruption
1. Generate multiple peer IDs until collision
2. Impersonate legitimate peers
3. Send malformed packets causing crashes
4. Replay old messages causing confusion

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Implement device pairing with PIN authentication
2. Move all keys to iOS Keychain with biometric protection
3. Add comprehensive bounds checking to protocol parser
4. Reduce replay window to 30 seconds
5. Use random salts for password derivation

### Long-term Improvements
1. Implement mutual authentication protocol
2. Add forward secrecy with ephemeral keys
3. Implement rate limiting and DoS protection
4. Add security audit logging
5. Regular security assessments
