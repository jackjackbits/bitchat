# Noise Protocol Swift/iOS Implementation Research

**Author**: Unit 221B  
**Date**: January 9, 2025  
**Project**: BitChat Secure Messaging

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of available Noise Protocol implementations for Swift/iOS, evaluating their suitability for integration into the BitChat secure messaging application. The research covers native Swift libraries, Objective-C bridges, C/C++ integrations, and production-ready implementations.

## Available Implementations

### 1. OuterCorner/Noise (Recommended for Production)

**GitHub**: https://github.com/OuterCorner/Noise  
**Language**: Objective-C with Swift compatibility  
**License**: Check repository for specific license  
**Maintenance**: Active  

**Key Features**:
- Production-ready implementation wrapping the battle-tested noise-c library
- Full iOS and macOS compatibility
- Object-oriented API with Swift-friendly interface
- Central NPFSession class for protocol management

**Integration Method**:
```swift
// Via Carthage
github "OuterCorner/Noise"

// Dependencies required:
// - OpenSSL.framework
// - noise-c library (wrapped)
```

**Pros**:
- Most mature and production-tested option
- Based on proven noise-c library
- Already used in production environments
- Good documentation and examples

**Cons**:
- Objective-C base (though Swift-compatible)
- Requires OpenSSL dependency
- Additional C library dependency

### 2. swift-libp2p/swift-noise

**GitHub**: https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-noise  
**Language**: Pure Swift  
**License**: Check repository for specific license  
**Maintenance**: Active but experimental  

**Key Features**:
- Pure Swift implementation
- Part of the libp2p ecosystem
- Swift Package Manager compatible
- No external C dependencies

**Integration Method**:
```swift
// Package.swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/swift-libp2p/swift-noise.git", from: "0.1.0")
]

// Target
.target(
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Noise", package: "swift-noise"),
    ]
)
```

**API Example**:
```swift
// Initialize handshake
let handshake = Noise.HandshakeState(config: Noise.Config)

// Write message
let (buffer, c1, c2) = try handshake.writeMessage(payload: payloadBytes)

// Read message
let (payload, c1, c2) = try handshake.readMessage(inboundMessage)
```

**Pros**:
- Pure Swift implementation
- Modern Swift API
- No C/Objective-C dependencies
- Easy Swift Package Manager integration

**Cons**:
- Explicitly marked as not production-ready
- Limited testing in real-world applications
- Potential bugs in handshake logic
- Less battle-tested than noise-c based solutions

### 3. WireGuard iOS Implementation

**GitHub**: https://github.com/WireGuard/wireguard-apple  
**Reference Implementation**: Uses Noise Protocol internally  

**Key Points**:
- WireGuard uses Noise_IK pattern
- Not directly usable as a library
- Good reference for production Noise usage
- Uses noise-c under the hood via wireguard-go-bridge

**WireGuardKit Integration**:
- Available as Swift Package
- Links against wireguard-go-bridge
- Could be studied for implementation patterns

### 4. OperatorFoundation WireGuard (Archived)

**GitHub**: https://github.com/OperatorFoundation/WireGuard  
**Status**: Archived/Read-only  

- Swift implementation of WireGuard client
- No longer maintained
- Useful as reference implementation only

## Cryptographic Primitives Support

### Apple CryptoKit Compatibility

CryptoKit provides the necessary primitives for Noise Protocol:

1. **ChaCha20-Poly1305**: Available via `ChaChaPoly` class
2. **X25519**: Available via `Curve25519` for key agreement
3. **BLAKE2**: Not directly available in CryptoKit
4. **SHA256**: Available in CryptoKit

**Implementation Approach with CryptoKit**:
```swift
import CryptoKit

// Use for symmetric encryption
let cipher = try ChaChaPoly.seal(plaintext, using: key)

// Use for key agreement
let privateKey = Curve25519.KeyAgreement.PrivateKey()
let sharedSecret = try privateKey.sharedSecretFromKeyAgreement(with: publicKey)
```

### Integration Strategies

#### Strategy 1: Use OuterCorner/Noise (Recommended)

For production applications requiring stability:

1. Add framework via Carthage or direct inclusion
2. Include OpenSSL.framework dependency
3. Use NPFSession for protocol management
4. Implement wrapper classes for Swift convenience

#### Strategy 2: Use swift-noise with Caution

For experimental or non-critical applications:

1. Add via Swift Package Manager
2. Implement extensive testing
3. Consider contributing fixes back to the project
4. Monitor for updates and security audits

#### Strategy 3: Custom Implementation with CryptoKit

For maximum control and iOS-native approach:

1. Use CryptoKit for crypto primitives
2. Implement Noise state machine manually
3. Follow Noise specification exactly
4. Extensive testing and potential security audit

## Production Usage Examples

The Noise Protocol is used in production by:

- **WhatsApp**: Uses Noise Pipes for client-server encryption
- **WireGuard**: Uses Noise_IK for VPN tunnels
- **Slack Nebula**: Uses Noise for overlay networking
- **Signal**: Uses similar patterns (though custom protocol)

## Licensing Considerations

1. **noise-c**: Public domain
2. **OuterCorner/Noise**: Check repository for specific license
3. **swift-noise**: Check repository for specific license
4. **CryptoKit**: Apple framework, standard iOS license

## Recommendations for BitChat

### Primary Recommendation

Use **OuterCorner/Noise** for the following reasons:

1. Production-tested implementation
2. Based on proven noise-c library
3. Active maintenance
4. Good iOS/macOS compatibility
5. Swift-friendly API despite Objective-C base

### Implementation Steps

1. **Phase 1**: Prototype with OuterCorner/Noise
   - Integrate framework
   - Implement basic handshake patterns
   - Test with reference implementations

2. **Phase 2**: Evaluate Performance
   - Benchmark encryption/decryption
   - Test battery impact
   - Measure memory usage

3. **Phase 3**: Production Integration
   - Implement full protocol suite
   - Add error handling
   - Security audit if needed

### Alternative Approach

If pure Swift is required:

1. Start with swift-noise for prototyping
2. Contribute improvements back to the project
3. Consider funding security audit
4. Maintain fork if necessary

## Security Considerations

1. **Formal Verification**: The Noise Protocol has undergone formal analysis
2. **Implementation Bugs**: Choose battle-tested implementations
3. **Side Channels**: Consider timing attacks in any implementation
4. **Random Number Generation**: Ensure proper entropy sources

## Conclusion

For BitChat's requirements as a secure messaging application, the OuterCorner/Noise implementation provides the best balance of stability, performance, and iOS compatibility. While swift-noise offers a more modern Swift approach, its experimental status makes it unsuitable for production use without significant additional testing and development.

The Noise Protocol's use in WhatsApp, WireGuard, and other production systems validates its security properties, making it an excellent choice for BitChat's encryption layer.
